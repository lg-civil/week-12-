# Objective:
# Students will manipulate nested lists and understand basic list comprehensions.

# Key Notes:

# A list can contain other lists.

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Examples:Objective:
# Students will manipulate nested lists and understand basic list comprehensions.

# Key Notes:

# A list can contain other lists.

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

# Examples:

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print(matrix[1][2])    # 6


# List comprehension
first_col = [row[0] for row in matrix]
print(first_col)       # [1, 4, 7]



# Practice Problems:

# Build a matrix variable containing 3 lists of 3 numbers each.

matrix = [
    [10, 20, 30],
    [40, 50, 60],
    [70, 80, 90]
]

# Print the first list.

print(matrix[0])

# Print the second item from the third list.

print(matrix[2][1])

# Use a list comprehension to extract the last item from each sub-list.

sum_list = [row[-1] for row in matrix] 
print(sum_list) # Output: [30, 60, 90]

# Challenge: Create a new list containing squares of numbers from 1–10 using a comprehension.

squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]
# for x in range(1, 11):
#     print(x**2)
print(squares)
